Our game run on a graph with vertices and edges. 
### Details And Goals
* The level of the game is determined by the server (we will explain about it later in WIKI). <br/>
* There are 16 stages (0-15) to the game. <br/>
* Each game has a different number of agents and pokemons. <br/>
* Our purpose it's catch as much as possible of pokemons with the agent. <br/>
